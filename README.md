* This readme file provides an overview of our machine learning project, which aims to develop a recommender engine for educational institutions and policymakers.The engine utilizes various geographic and demographic factors to recommend the type of school that should be built in a particular area. The purpose of this project is to assist decision-makers in making informed choices about school planning and development. The readme file will highlight the features of our project and provide instructions on how to use it.This project was the output for Sprint 2 of the Data Science Fellowship program at Eskwelabs, which focused on machine learning. We hope that this project will be helpful to those interested in exploring the intersection of machine learning and education.
